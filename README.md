#   Call Santa – Multilingual Chat Web App

A login-free chat application built allowing users to interact with Santa in **English, Malayalam, Manglish, or mixed text**. The app keeps the experience lightweight and personal with language-aware Santa responses.

---

##  Purpose

The goal of this project is to deliver a simple but engaging chat experience with Santa that:
- Requires **no login or personal data**
- Works instantly on opening the app
- Understands multiple language styles and responds naturally in the same format

---

##  Core Features



The chat UI is responsive and minimal, works on all modern browsers, and prioritizes chat as the main interaction. Language detection is rule-based to avoid external API dependency and ensure the project stays free to run.

---

##  Tech Used

This app is built using **React (Vite) + TypeScript** with **Tailwind CSS** for styling. The chat behavior, state management, and language recognition are written in TypeScript. Deployment is supported through Netlify or Vercel, both of which handle Vite + TypeScript projects smoothly.
